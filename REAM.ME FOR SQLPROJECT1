This project is a comprehensive **Student Management System** built using **MySQL**. It effectively manages student records, teacher details, class data, and subject information.

Project Overview

This project includes:
- **Database Schema Design** for structured data storage.  
- **CRUD Operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for efficient data management.  
- Advanced queries for data retrieval, filtering, and analysis.

How to Run

1. Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/SQL-PROJECTS.git
```

2. Open MySQL Workbench or Command Line Interface.

3. Run `.sql` files in the following order:
- `schema.sql` â†’ *(For database and table creation)*
- `data.sql` â†’ *(For inserting sample data)*
- `queries.sql` â†’ *(For executing various queries)*
